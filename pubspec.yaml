  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Roboto
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Fonts/Roboto-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
